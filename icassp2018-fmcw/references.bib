In this paper an approach is investigated to combine the advantages of both principles. Therefore an FMCW radar will be extended with an additional phase evaluation technique. In order to realize this combination an increased range resolution of the FMCW radar is required. This paper describes an frequency estimation algorithm to increase the frequency resolution and hence the range resolution of an FMCW radar at 24 GHz for a line based range detection system to evaluate the possibility of an extended FMCW radar using the phase information.},

We present the details of the proposed method, and the modifications we made to implement it on-board an autonomous ground vehicle for real-time data processing. Finally,we present results produced from different stationary laser sensors and from field tests using an unmanned ground vehicle. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

We report 2.4-mW single-mode output under continuous-wave operation at 15°C. We show that, despite broadened by the Brownian motion, the HCG-VCSEL has a total linewidth of 60 MHz or a coherent length of 5 m in air, and an intrinsic linewidth {\textless};20 MHz. Transmission of directly modulated 10 Gbps over 100-km dispersion-compensated single-mode fiber is demonstrated. Tunable HCG-VCSEL is demonstrated with the HCG integrated with a micro-electro-mechanical structure. Continuous wavelength tuning as wide as 26.3 nm is achieved. The tunable VCSEL was used as a source for external modulation for 40-Gbps differential-phase-shift-keyed signal and transmitted over 100-km dispersion-compensated link with negligible power penalty.},

	abstract = {3D imaging technologies are applied in numerous areas, including self-driving cars, drones, and robots, and in advanced industrial, medical, scientific, and consumer applications. 3D imaging is usually accomplished by finding the distance to multiple points on an object or in a scene, and then creating a point cloud of those range measurements. Different methods can be used for the ranging. Some of these methods, such as stereovision, rely on processing 2D images. Other techniques estimate the distance more directly by measuring the round-trip delay of an ultrasonic or electromagnetic wave to the object. Ultrasonic waves suffer large losses in air and cannot reach distances beyond a few meters. Radars and lidars use electromagnetic waves in radio and optical spectra, respectively. The shorter wavelengths of the optical waves compared to the radio frequency waves translates into better resolution, and a more favorable choice for 3D imaging. The integration of lidars on electronic and photonic chips can lower their cost, size, and power consumption, making them affordable and accessible to all the abovementioned applications. This review article explains different lidar aspects and design choices, such as optical modulation and detection techniques, and point cloud generation by means of beam-steering or flashing an entire scene. Popular lidar architectures and circuits are presented, and the superiority of the FMCW lidar is discussed in terms of range resolution, receiver sensitivity, and compatibility with emerging technologies. At the end, an electronic-photonic integrated circuit for a micro-imaging FMCW lidar is presented as an example.},
